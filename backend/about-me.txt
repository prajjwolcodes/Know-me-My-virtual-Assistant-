Prajjwol Shrestha is a passionate and relentlessly curious full stack web developer who specializes in building high-performance, real-world applications using Next.js. With around a year of experience, his roots are in the MERN stack, but he has quickly transitioned to mastering the full-stack capabilities of Next.js to broaden his job opportunities and accelerate his development workflow. His code is clean, scalable, and often indistinguishable from production-grade work. From dynamic routing and API routes to server actions and app directory structure, Prajjwol pushes the edge of what’s possible with modern React-based development.

He has built a variety of practical and visually engaging apps including a food ordering website that generates PDF receipts after checkout, a social media platform with real-time follow/unfollow sync and follower count display, and a sleek music event booking site. His Jamendo API-based audio player is one of his proudest projects — equipped with shuffle, repeat, vertical volume control, keyboard shortcuts, and a beautiful UI crafted with Tailwind CSS.

Prajjwol’s frontend stack revolves around React.js, Next.js (latest features), and Tailwind CSS, where he brings UIs to life with micro-interactions and component libraries inspired by apps like Instagram. On the backend, he utilizes Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB (via Mongoose). He handles data and networking through Axios, REST APIs, and has foundational knowledge of React Query for caching and fetching. Authentication and theming? He’s implemented `next-themes` like a pro.

He isn’t just writing code — he’s building intelligent systems. Prajjwol has experimented deeply with LangChain for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems using SupabaseVectorStore and Google Generative AI embeddings. He’s implemented full pipelines for embedding `.txt` documents and built AI-powered systems to answer questions about himself. His ability to debug deeply — like tracing overwritten questions during LLM parsing — shows how practically he learns and how deeply he wants to understand end-to-end systems.

His development style is unique — he learns by doing. Documentation isn’t his primary source; he prefers videos, listening, and hands-on practice. He even records himself speaking English to improve communication, taking self-growth as seriously as software design. This learning-by-building mindset has led him to develop reusable components like `AppointmentList`, searchable UI tables, Google Calendar integrations, and styled calendar systems using FullCalendar.

Outside of code, Prajjwol is a fitness enthusiast. He runs every morning, hits the gym hard from 6 to 8 p.m., takes his meals and creatine with precision, and consumes protein in the morning — all aligned with his fat loss journey. His lifestyle reflects his approach to coding: intense, consistent, and always evolving.

He recently completed a 4-month internship (6000 NPR/month), working on MIS dashboards and applications, and is now exploring new professional opportunities. He’s used Linux (Pop!_OS) on a low-end PC to its full potential — even gaming and coding on it. Due to space limitations, he prefers installing games on Local Disk D. He enjoys local multiplayer football games on Steam like eFootball, played with controllers on the same PC.

In his downtime, he tinkers with AI video generation using Google Gemini’s VEO3, brainstorms creative prompts, and even explores philosophical and business questions about equity and company valuations. Every aspect of his work and life is an experiment — a continuous build and improve loop.

Prajjwol is not just another Next.js developer. He is building an ecosystem around his ideas, pushing the limits of what a single developer can do with modern tools. With every line of code, sketch, workout, and experiment, he is crafting a future where the developer is not just the builder — but also the architect, the artist, and the storyteller.
